    "\n",
    "The Coma Cluster is an ensemble of over 1000 galaxies that takes its name from the constellation Coma Berenices. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goals of this notebook tutorial are to:\n",
    " 1. examine the Coma cluster of galaxies (Abell 1656) using services and data from the virtual observatory within a jupyter notebook. This allows a quick evaluation of the mean redshift and velocity dispersion of the cluster. Both measurements are important to study the evolution of galaxy clusters. To do so we use redshifts and photometry (Petrosian r magnitude) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey ([SDSS](https://www.sdss.org/)) and then add redshifts from the Cluster And Infall Region Nearby Survey ([CAIRNS](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/378599)) (Rines et al. 2003). This improves the completeness of the redshift sample,\n",
    " 2. research the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes ([MAST](https://archive.stsci.edu/)) for Hubble Space Telescope (HST) spectra in the region of the Coma cluster,\n",
    " 3. download a spectrum from MAST and do a quick analysis of the redshift of the emission lines in the spectrum. "
