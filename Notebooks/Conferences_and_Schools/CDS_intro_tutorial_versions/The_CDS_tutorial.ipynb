    "# CDS services in jupyter notebooks\n",
    "Welcome to a Jupyter notebook demonstrating how to access some CDS services with Python. Jupyter notebooks offer an interactive way to use Python. If you are viewing this notebook with Binder you can execute every cell of code either by pushing the little 'play' <img src=\"images/jupyter_run-cell.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width:70px; display: inline-block;\"/> symbol on the left of the cell (appears when the mouse pointer moves in its vincitity) or by selecting a cell and pressing 'Shift' + 'Enter' at the same time. Note that cells that have not yet been executed have no number assigned to them, later on they are assigned the number of the order in which they were executed. If they are run again, they get a new number. \n",
